"""PySide6 application entry point.

Sub-phase 3c-ii second pass added the workflow launcher wiring —
``app.py`` now constructs ``RipperEngine`` + ``RipperController`` +
``WorkflowLauncher`` alongside the ``MainWindow``, mirroring the
tkinter init order at ``gui/main_window.py:368``.

Workflow buttons now reach the controller; status / progress / log
callbacks marshal back via ``gui_qt.thread_safety``.

Still pending in 3c-ii:

* ``ask_tv_setup`` / ``ask_movie_setup`` — multi-field forms
* ``show_disc_tree`` — tree-view selector dialog
* ``show_temp_manager`` — separate window (3c-iii territory)

Out of scope:

* Settings dialog + theme picker — Phase 3d
* MKV preview — Phase 3e
