"""Update-check entrypoint for the JellyRip UI.

Phase 3h (2026-05-04) — the prior implementation lived in
``gui/update_ui.py`` and depended heavily on tkinter-specific GUI
APIs (``gui.after()`` for thread-safe callbacks, ``gui.destroy()``
for window teardown). When the tkinter UI was retired the function
was not ported one-to-one because the Qt shell uses different
threading primitives (``gui_qt.thread_safety.submit_to_main``) and
a different teardown idiom (``QMainWindow.close()``).

Rather than do a half-finished port, this module exposes a stub
``check_for_updates(window)`` that logs a clear "feature deferred"
message. The Updates utility chip in ``gui_qt/utility_handlers.py``
calls this stub. A Qt-native rewrite is scheduled as a polish-tier
follow-up — see ``docs/handoffs/phase-3h-tkinter-retirement.md``
Step 3 notes.

The previous implementation is preserved in git history at
``gui/update_ui.py`` (commit before tkinter retirement) for
reference when the Qt port lands.
