# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

## [1.0.16] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Improved FFmpeg abort handling, copy-progress logging, and transcode validation for more reliable encode and packaging flows.
- Restored the richer `JellyRip.spec` release configuration so packaged builds consistently carry version metadata, bundled FFmpeg assets, and runtime dependencies.
- Aligned release metadata on the `1.0.16` line across the app runtime, installer, docs, tester worksheet, and release notes.

### Fixed

- Build output policy is back in sync with the docs: release executables stay in GitHub Releases instead of being tracked in the repository.
- In-app update checks now follow the newest published release, including unstable prereleases, so the updater no longer falls back to the older stable line.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Restored a visible top-level `ABORT SESSION` control so the user can abort a running task even when the inline prompt bar is hidden.
- Fixed log auto-follow behavior by checking whether the log was already near the bottom before appending new text.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Added plain controller boundary modules for session paths, rip validation/retry policy, session recovery, and TV library scanning.
- Added direct unit coverage for those extracted modules so the logic can be tested without importing Tk or the legacy controller mixin.
- Added a release consistency guard that checks version alignment and prevents the root `JellyRip.exe` binary from being tracked in git.

### Changed

- Shrank `controller/legacy_compat.py` by turning session path, rip validation, session recovery, and library scan helpers into thin compatibility wrappers.
- Moved resume selection prompt-model logic out of `SessionHelpers.check_resume` while keeping the UI yes/no callback at the edge.
- Kept the full behavior-guard suite passing while expanding the test suite to cover 250 checks.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- FFmpeg source handling now offers two user-facing modes: `Safe (Copy First)` and `Fast (Read Original)`, with plain-language explanations in Settings and the queue builder.

### Changed

- The current working release line is now aligned as `1.0.13`, with `1.0.12` left as the previous git revision point.
- FFmpeg queue jobs and one-click recommendations now carry the selected source-handling mode through to logs and execution.

### Fixed

- `JellyRip.exe` now embeds Windows file and product version metadata so the next build shows a clean application version in Explorer.
- Release metadata files (`README`, release notes, installer version, and release script examples) are synchronized for the `1.0.13` line.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- In-app updater now launches `JellyRipInstaller.exe` in silent in-place update mode (`/VERYSILENT /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /NORESTART`) and falls back to normal launch if silent invocation fails.
- Inno Setup installer is now explicitly configured for update flows (`UsePreviousAppDir`, `CloseApplications`, `CloseApplicationsFilter`, `RestartApplications=no`) so reinstalling acts as an updater.
- Build and release scripts now build via `JellyRip.spec` instead of ad-hoc CLI flags, ensuring release artifacts consistently include the same runtime hooks and bundled dependencies as tested builds.

### Fixed

- Movie resume path now always uses a fresh temp rip folder instead of reusing the previous session folder, preventing `_purge_rip_target_files` from deleting previously successful MKVs during a retry.
- Smart Rip now exits immediately when abort is triggered during metadata prompts (title/year/metadata), avoiding fallback-name/0000-year continuation after user abort.
- Auto-title fallback is now informational log output only and no longer appears as a session warning/failure summary line.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- CINFO disc-level parsing: scan now extracts disc title, language code, language name, and volume ID from MakeMKV output.
- `--minlength` scan filter: new `opt_minlength_seconds` setting (Advanced → MakeMKV) tells MakeMKV to skip titles shorter than the configured threshold during scan.
- Jellyfin metadata ID prompts: Smart Rip, Manual Disc, and Organize flows now ask for an optional TMDB/IMDB/TVDB ID. Folder names get Jellyfin-compatible tags like `[tmdbid-603]` or `[imdbid-tt1375666]`.
- `parse_metadata_id()` accepts flexible input formats: `tmdb:12345`, `tmdb-12345`, `tt1234567`, `tvdb:79168`, or bare integers (assumed TMDB).
- `build_movie_folder_name()` and `build_tv_folder_name()` centralize Jellyfin-style folder naming with optional metadata tags.
- 34 new tests for the naming module (180 total tests passing).

### Changed

- `build_fallback_title()` now prefers CINFO disc name over per-title TINFO name when the disc name is available and non-generic.
- Generic disc name detection expanded to catch both "Title NN" and "Title_NN" patterns plus "Disc"-prefixed names.

### Fixed

- Fixed 73 mojibake em dashes in controller.py (triple-encoded UTF-8 bytes replaced with proper U+2014).

## [1.0.10] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Added repository-standard project files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and a Windows GitHub Actions test workflow.
- Added `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/repository-layout.md` to explain the app's layered design and flat-layout rationale.
- Added settings for optional prompt auto-timeouts and optional unattended disc-swap timeouts.
- Added unified tool resolver layer (`resolve_tool`, `resolve_makemkvcon`, `resolve_ffprobe`) with resolution order: saved config → common install paths → PATH environment variable.
- Added `validate_makemkvcon` and `validate_ffprobe` helpers that run a live probe command and return a success flag and error message.
- Added `should_keep_current_tool_path` safeguard: a working saved tool path is never replaced by an unvalidated new path.
- Added `tests/test_config_tools.py` with 5 regression tests covering resolver order and the overwrite-guard rule.

### Changed

- Reworked repository documentation to better match the expectations of a maintained small Windows desktop app project.
- Updated preview-related tests so pytest never launches a real media player during local or CI test runs.
- Settings save flow now validates new tool paths before accepting them; rejects silently-broken replacements and logs the rejection reason.
- Engine `validate_tools` now routes both MakeMKV and ffprobe through the resolver layer so PATH installs and custom locations are found automatically.
- Multi-disc dump mode renamed from "Unattended" to "Dump All" in UI labels and log messages for clarity.
- Extras selection changed from a yes/no keep-all toggle to a multi-select picker so individual extra titles can be deselected.

### Fixed

- Multi-disc dump flow now pauses with an explicit between-disc confirmation prompt and no longer times out by default while waiting for user swap actions.
- Unrecognized discs during multi-disc dump can now be advanced manually (bypass) or stopped instead of being forced into retry-only behavior.
- GUI prompt timeout behaviour is now configurable via Settings → Advanced → Interactive Timeouts instead of being a hard-coded 300-second safety value.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-29

### Windows UX + path hardening

- Removed browse UI flows for now (Settings browse buttons and inline input browse) to keep path entry deterministic while Windows dialog stability work is deferred.
- Added `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` flags to Windows subprocess calls to stop black console-window flashes during MakeMKV/ffprobe/PowerShell operations.
- Update installer launch now uses `os.startfile(...)` with a pre-launch UAC notice so elevation is handed off to Windows correctly.
- Added Windows reserved-name and empty-name guards in `clean_name` (e.g. `NUL`, `COM1`) to avoid invalid or dangerous filenames.
- Added Windows-friendly path validation using probe-write checks (instead of `os.access(..., os.W_OK)`) and drive-letter-agnostic system-path blocking.
- Added long-path (`\\?\\`) file-I/O handling in the engine for move/copy/log/metadata operations so deep TV paths do not fail at 260 characters.

### Docs / release metadata sync

- README build instructions now use `main.py`, matching the current packaged entrypoint.
- Release notes now include both `JellyRip.exe` and `JellyRipInstaller.exe` download links for `v1.0.9` and `latest`.
- Documentation now states explicitly that generated `dist/` binaries are published through GitHub Releases and are not committed to the repository.

### Safety / Deadlock fixes (gui/main_window.py)

- **`ask_yesno`**: the wait loop now checks `abort_event` and applies a 300-second safety timeout, matching the existing guard in `ask_input`. Previously the loop was unbounded — if the `_abort_watch` thread failed to fire `done`, the worker thread would hang forever.
- **`ask_input` race condition**: added `self._input_lock = threading.Lock()` (initialised in `__init__`). Every call to `ask_input` acquires this lock before touching the shared `_input_result`/`_input_event` state, serialising concurrent prompts and eliminating the read-clobber race.

### Correctness fixes

- **`rip_selected_titles`** (engine/ripper_engine.py): return value changed from `(not abort, failed_titles)` to `(not abort and not bool(failed_titles), failed_titles)`. Previously `True` was returned even when individual titles failed, which was misleading — `_normalize_rip_result` was the real gate but the signal was confusing. The change is safe: callers all pass the result through `_normalize_rip_result` which does file-presence + ffprobe validation.
- **`SessionStateMachine.complete()`** (utils/state_machine.py): new method that forces the state to COMPLETED if the session has not already failed. Used by `_run_disc` which manages its own multi-disc loop and never tracked intermediate state transitions.
- **`_run_disc`** (controller/controller.py): calls `self.sm.complete()` before `write_session_summary()` at the end of the disc loop. Previously the state machine was always in INIT (never transitioned by this flow), causing `write_session_summary` to skip the COMPLETED branch and miss the warning-list display logic.

### Security fixes

- **Update download TOCTOU** (gui/main_window.py): replaced the predictable fixed temp path (`tempdir/JellyRipUpdate/`) with `tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="JellyRipUpdate_")`. The unique directory is cleaned up (`shutil.rmtree`) on every failure path and before early returns, preventing stale downloads from lingering.
- **Path injection in `get_authenticode_signature`** (utils/updater.py): replaced string-formatting the file path into a PowerShell command (only escaped single quotes, leaving backticks and `$(...)` injectable) with a `param([string]$p)` block and `-LiteralPath $p`. The path is now passed as a PowerShell parameter value, never interpolated into command text.

### Architecture / Bad patterns

- **`handle_fallback`** (utils/fallback.py): removed three `hasattr(controller, "_record_fallback_event")` duck-checks. The function is hardwired to `RipperController` — pretending to be generic via `hasattr` added noise without value. Direct calls are cleaner and any AttributeError is now a real programming error.
- **`shared/runtime.py` `__all__`**: removed all stdlib re-exports (`os`, `re`, `json`, `threading`, `datetime`, `tk`, `ttk`, etc.). `__all__` now only lists runtime constants and project-specific helpers. Stdlib is imported directly by callers.
- **`gui/main_window.py`**: replaced `from shared.runtime import *` with explicit imports of stdlib (os, re, json, tkinter, etc.) and the specific runtime symbols it needs.
- **`JellyRip.py`**: replaced `from shared.runtime import *` with explicit imports of only the symbols it re-exports.
- **`config.py`** and **`utils/helpers.py`**: replaced `from shared.runtime import json, os, shutil, ...` with direct stdlib imports.
- **`tests/test_imports.py`**: split GUI import into its own `test_gui_import` function guarded by `unittest.mock.patch("tkinter.Tk")`. The original test crashed on headless CI because tkinter requires a display at import time.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-28

### Code review fixes (10 issues closed)

- **`_normalize_rip_result`**: glob pattern changed to `**/*.mkv` with `recursive=True` — previously missed MKV files when MakeMKV wrote into subdirectories, causing rips to be silently treated as failures.
- **`get_available_drives`**: added `proc.wait(timeout=30)` with `kill()` on `TimeoutExpired` — previously the thread could hang indefinitely if `makemkvcon` stalled on startup.
- **`check_disk_space`**: removed `os.makedirs` side-effect; now returns early with a log warning if the target path doesn't exist rather than silently creating it.
- **`config.py` `load_config`**: split `except Exception` into `except json.JSONDecodeError` (logs "config corrupt, resetting") and a general `except Exception` (logs the actual error). Config loss is now visible to the user.
- **`clean_name`**: regex extended to strip ASCII control characters and null bytes (`\x00–\x1f`) in addition to forbidden filename characters — disc names with embedded control chars could silently corrupt filenames.
- **`scan_with_retry`**: removed unreachable `if result is not None` branch that followed an `if result is None: continue`.
- **`choose_best_title`**: pre-computes `score_title` once per candidate into a list and selects the max — previously called `score_title` twice on the winning title.
- **`_parse_int_or_default`** removed; call sites replaced with `safe_int(…)` (already imported from `utils.parsing`) with an `or 1` fallback where the default was non-zero.
- **`DummyGUI`** in `tests/test_behavior_guards.py`: added `set_progress`, `start_indeterminate`, `stop_indeterminate` stubs — missing methods caused `AttributeError` in any test that hit `scan_with_retry`.
- **README**: version header updated from v1.0.6 to v1.0.8.

### Correctness hardening — tiered integrity validation

- Replaced the single 60% duration threshold in `_verify_container_integrity` with a three-tier model: severe (<50% or <40% for short titles), likely-truncation (50–75% / 40–60%), minor mismatch (75–90% / 60–85%). Normal variance (≥90%) produces no warning.
- Added multi-signal escalation: a file only escalates to TRUNCATION ERROR when **both** duration and size are below threshold simultaneously, preventing false positives from inaccurate disc-scan metadata.
- Expected size values below 200 MB are now excluded from size-based escalation (disc scan metadata is unreliable for small titles).
- Multi-file titles (seamless branching) now aggregate their total duration/size before comparing against expected, preventing per-file false warnings.
- Duplicate warnings are deduplicated by `title_id` — at most one warning per logical title regardless of how many physical files it spans.
- Short titles (expected < 600 s) use widened tiers to account for higher relative variance in disc timing metadata.
- Both `run_smart_rip` and `_run_disc` (TV path) now pass `expected_durations`, `expected_sizes`, and `title_file_map` to `_verify_container_integrity`, making the tiered check universal across all ripping modes.
- In strict mode (`opt_strict_mode`), any tier below "minor" (< 75%) escalates to a hard failure.

### Attach to existing library

- New "Continue an existing show folder?" prompt at the start of every TV disc rip. Users can point JellyRip at a show folder that was created in a previous session (or by another tool); the app scans for existing season folders and episode files and writes new episodes directly into that folder.
- `_scan_library_folder(show_root)` scans a show root for `Season XX` subdirectories and their episode files, returning a dict of `{season_num: [ep_nums]}`. Used to display which seasons already exist in the prompt.
- `_scan_episode_files(folder, season)` recognises three naming formats: `SxxEyy` (standard), `Nx01` (1x01), and `Episode N`. Case-insensitive. Only reads the directory listing.
- `get_next_episode(existing)` implements gap-fill logic: returns the lowest missing episode number rather than simply appending after the highest. If Season 1 has E01, E02, E04 (E03 missing), the next suggestion is E03.
- Episode number prompt in `_select_and_move` now pre-fills using gap-fill logic and logs whether it is "gap-filling from" or "continuing from" the detected offset.
- When an existing library folder is selected the season prompt shows which seasons were detected (e.g. `S01  S02`) and the destination is written directly into the selected folder rather than constructing a new path under `tv_root`.

### Regression tests

- 5 regression tests for tiered integrity: severe warn-only (no size), severe + size escalation, expected-size clamping, strict-mode failure, minor mismatch passes.
- 8 regression tests for integrity aggregation: multi-file title aggregation, dedup (one warning per title), size floor, short-title tolerance.
- 4 tests for `get_next_episode` gap-fill.
- 6 tests for `_scan_highest_episode` / `_scan_episode_files` (compat wrapper, case-insensitive, season isolation, missing folder, None dest_folder, `1x01` format, `Episode N` format).
- 5 tests for `_scan_library_folder` (season dir detection, non-season dir exclusion, empty root, missing path, sorted episode lists).

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-28

### Correctness hardening

- Eliminated duplicate ffprobe analysis passes in TV/Movie disc (`_run_disc`) and Smart Rip (`run_smart_rip`) pipelines. `analyze_files()` result is now shared with `_verify_container_integrity()` via a new `analyzed=` parameter — each file is probed exactly once per pipeline step.
- Fixed `run_smart_rip` state machine: `STABILIZED` transition was missing on the normal (non-retry) path; `VALIDATED` transition was dead code (placed after an unconditional `return`). Both are now correctly placed on the success path.
- Fixed `run_organize()` path drift: removed early `cfg["tv_folder"]` / `cfg["movies_folder"]` / `cfg["temp_folder"]` reads that silently bypassed run-time path overrides. All three folder roots now derive exclusively from `get_path()` after `_init_session_paths()`.
- Added `_ensure_session_paths()` guard: raises `RuntimeError` immediately if `session_paths` has not been initialized, making misconfigured calls fail loudly rather than silently writing to the wrong folder.
- Cleaned up post-stabilization size advisory log to use the format: `X MB (below threshold — expected Y GB → threshold Z GB)`.
- Replaced exit-code-based rip failure forcing with validation-based degraded success classification. MakeMKV frequently exits non-zero on real discs even when output is usable; the engine now checks whether files were actually produced. Non-zero exit + files present → degraded success (warning added to session report, downstream stabilization and ffprobe still validate the file). Non-zero exit + no files → real failure, unchanged. Session summary now distinguishes "All discs completed successfully" from "Completed with warnings" when degraded titles were detected.

### Test coverage

- Added 7 regression tests covering `_ensure_session_paths`, `_verify_container_integrity` with and without pre-analyzed data, integrity failure cases (zero duration, count mismatch), and advisory log format.
- Added 4 regression tests for degraded rip classification: degraded success path, real failure path (no files), session report population, and session summary warnings vs. clean success branching.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-27

### New features

- Added per-title Preview actions in the title picker, including short disposable sample rips and VLC launch support.
- Added fallback title naming mode in Settings with friendly options: timestamp, auto title, or auto title plus timestamp.

### Resume and workflow improvements

- Expanded workflow-level resume metadata to restore key inputs (title, year, season, selected titles, episode fields).
- Added resume-aware defaults in input prompts so interrupted sessions can continue with less manual re-entry.
- Added metadata phase tracking updates through setup, ripping, analyzing, moving, failed, and complete states.

### Reliability hardening

- Enforced all-or-nothing rip normalization: aborts, failed titles, missing outputs, or invalid outputs are treated as session failure.
- Added failed-session cleanup that wipes output files while preserving metadata for future workflow resume.
- Added pre-rip target file purge for `.mkv` and `.partial` files to prevent file-level resume artifacts.
- Added regression guard coverage that enforces `rc != 0` as failure even if MKV output files exist.
- Added complementary guard coverage that enforces abort as failure even when output files are present and ffprobe-valid.

### UI and settings

- Reworked Settings into tabbed sections for easier navigation across Paths, Everyday, Validation, Advanced, and Logs.
- Added low-confidence Smart Rip threshold control and improved naming-mode presentation in the settings UI.
- Added a top-bar Check Updates action that checks GitHub Releases and can download/launch update packages.

### Distribution

- Added Inno Setup installer support (`installer/JellyRip.iss`) targeting per-user install at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\JellyRip`.
- Added `build_installer.bat` to build both `JellyRip.exe` and `JellyRipInstaller.exe`.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-25

### Critical bug fixes

- **Fixed Movie/Unattended mode deadlock**: Movie and Unattended buttons now work without freezing. Moved mode-picker logic from main thread to background thread to prevent tkinter callback deadlock during dialog prompts.
- **Fixed log file path handling**: Log file paths without `.txt` extension are now automatically suffixed to prevent "Permission denied" errors on Windows.
- **Enhanced analysis error handling**: Added explicit logging of analysis results and exception handling to help debug silent failures during file analysis.
- **Fixed abort during mode picker starting task**: Pressing Abort while the "Movie/Unattended mode?" prompt is showing no longer starts the rip — it now cancels cleanly.

### Features

- **Smart Rip now asks to keep extras**: After auto-selecting the main feature, Smart Rip now asks "Keep extras from this disc?" and rips/moves all additional titles to the Extras folder if yes.

### UI/UX improvements

- Better error messages when file analysis fails, with option to retry instead of silently skipping.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-25

### Reliability and parsing hardening

- Hardened duration parsing so malformed values safely default to 0.
- Hardened size parsing to tolerate variants like 3.7GB, 3,7 GB, and trailing text.
- Added safe dictionary access for optional audio and subtitle track lists in scoring/logging paths.

### Ripping and process stability

- Kept rip success based on MakeMKV exit code while preserving fallback behavior when files are actually produced on non-zero exits.
- Maintained abort-safe process handling with local subprocess snapshot usage.
- Added extra guardrails for destination path race conditions during atomic move.

### Observability and diagnostics

- Added optional safe_int debug warnings (de-duplicated and throttled; off by default).
- Added optional malformed-duration debug warnings (de-duplicated and throttled; off by default).
- Expanded score visibility with explicit score breakdown and ambiguity warning when top candidates are close.

### Testing and docs

- Added printable live-rip pass/fail worksheet for testers: TESTERS.md.
- Updated README links so testers can find worksheet and issue reporting flow quickly.
