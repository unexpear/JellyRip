# JellyRip v1.0.26 Release Notes

JellyRip v1.0.26 — a workflow + UI pass on the TV ripping flow.  Watch a
title before you rip it, name and number episodes right in the disc
picker (the old post-rip prompts are gone), plus a tactile polish pass
across the UI.

## Added

- **Watch a title before ripping.** "Watch in VLC" in the disc picker
  rips the selected title to a temporary file and plays it, so you can
  confirm what a title is before committing to a full rip.
- **Name and number episodes in the picker.** Editable **Ep #** and
  **Episode name** columns, with each title's length and size beside it.
  A title left without a number is filed as an extra.
- **Cut / Copy / Paste in the picker's editable cells** (right-click
  menu; Ctrl+C / V / X also work).

## Changed

- **The post-rip Episode Numbers / Episode Names prompts are gone.** A
  TV rip builds its plan straight from the picker.  Duplicate-number and
  existing-file safety checks still run, ending in a move preview.
- **TV picker and file lists sort by title number**, and each title
  shows both "Title N" and MakeMKV's real output filename.

## Polish

- **Tactile UI pass.** Press and focus states on buttons, pointing-hand
  cursors on clickable controls, and hover/selected states on inputs and
  rows — derived per-theme, so every built-in and custom theme gets it.

## Companion fork: JellyRip AI

The AI fork ships the same workflow + UI changes plus its assistant
layer (chat sidebar, AI providers, and TMDB/OMDb — plus TVmaze/TheTVDB
for TV — disc auto-identification).
