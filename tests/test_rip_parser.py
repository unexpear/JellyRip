"""Tests for the makemkvcon stdout parser inside RipperEngine._run_rip_process.

Seam: monkeypatch `subprocess.Popen` in `engine.ripper_engine` to return a
fake process whose stdout pipe yields canned makemkvcon output. The real
`_stdout_reader` thread pushes lines into the queue; the real parser loop
processes them. We assert against `on_progress` / `on_log` callbacks and
the function's return value.

Covered (per memory/test-coverage.md §3 corrected scope):
- Clean PRGV progression → monotonic progress + rc==0 → True
- PRGT / PRGC parsing → reaches on_log
- MSG parsing → reaches on_log via MakeMKVMessageCoalescer
- Malformed PRGV (`PRGV:not,a,number`) → silently skipped, no crash
- MSG with too few fields → silently skipped, no crash
- Non-zero exit code → returns False, exit code still logged
- abort_event set before run → returns False fast, no parsing
- abort_event set mid-stream (via on_progress callback) → returns False,
  terminate called
- MakeMKV exit code line is always logged
